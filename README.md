### Data Exchange Layer X-Road

The X-Road was launched in 2001. The data exchange layer X-Road is a technical and organisational environment, which enables secure Internet-based data exchange between the state’s information systems.

The X-Road is not only a technical solution, the exchange of data with the databases belonging to the state information system and between the databases belonging to the state information system shall be carried out through the data exchange layer of the state information system. The X-Road allows institutions/people to securely exchange data as well as to ensure people’s access to the data maintained and processed in state databases.

Public and private sector enterprises and institutions can connect their information system with the X-Road. This enables them to use X-Road services in their own electronic environment or offer their e-services via the X-Road. Joining the X-Road enables institutions to save resources, since the data exchange layer already exists. This makes data exchange more effective both inside the state institutions as well as regarding the communication between a citizen and the state.

Things achieved on the DevDay of 11.02.2015

* Code was changed: https://github.com/educloudalliance/xroad-rest-gateway/compare/master%40%7B1423059079%7D...master
* Initial scepticism about the come-together-see-what-happens approach was firmly debunked
* Two more people have the gateway running/building on their boxes
* Several discoveries were made about how to improve documentation 
* X-Road ongoing maintenance and cooperation setup was discussed: a decision about syncing between technical parties should technical terms be lost in the two stages of legal translation
* Compatibility with x-road v5 identified, work on porting started
* We need more meetings like this. There is a need to find reasons for business folks to be there
* Metadata collection pilot (a slight deviation from the main theme) was discussed, preliminary OK given for cooperation
* A need for API design guidelines identified: FI has an opportunity to start from a clean page while EE is stuck with API legacy

**TODO**
* Next meeting in Finland 18.3.2015
* enhancements and polishing the code written today
* Only GET is supported in the REST support, add POST (and other verbs)
* Artur will work on v5 compatibility, we shall review progress on next meeting
* Andres will look at the possibility to add browser-based access
* Petteri will improve the documentation and apply general magic to his code
